        		<h2>How the training works:</h2>
        	<p class="box-content">The website aims to educate and test users' knowledge of the hackers' mindset using the six principles of 				influence. </p>

        	<p class="box-content">First complete the survey to gain an understand of your knowledge before starting the training. </p>

        	<p class="box-content">Next choose your focus group: </p>
        	<ul class="box-content">
          		<li>Focus Group 1 uses comics to educate and test.</li>
          		<li>Focus Group 2 uses simple blocks of text to educate and test.</li>
        	</ul>

        	<p class="box-content">The website will then show you six scenarios in your chosen format and explain how the principle of 					influence was used in each scenario of a successful social engineering attack. </p>

        	<p class="box-content">Once you have viewed all the educational-based scenarios, the website will present you with six new 					scenarios, and you must then select the main principle of influence you believe is being implemented within the scenario from the 			  multiple choice form. </p>

        	<p class="box-content">Once you have completed all six testing scenarios, you will have completed the training. </p>
