Fred uses the principle of commitment and consistency by identifying Jack's commitment to donate to a charity for underprivileged children. Next, he created a fake charity organization similar to the one Jack had pledged to donate already.

Finally, by pretending to be a charity organization, Fred can convince Jack to follow his commitment and provide his login credentials.
