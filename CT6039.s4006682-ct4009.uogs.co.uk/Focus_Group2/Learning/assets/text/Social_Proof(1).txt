Fred creates a fake social media profile that looks like it belongs to a well-known company or celebrity. Fred then posts a message claiming they have just discovered a unique new product or service and provides a link for Jack to learn more. Fred's message is designed to look like it was shared by many others and with fake comments from other supposed satisfied customers. His link leads to his fake website, where Jack is prompted to enter their personal or credit information.
