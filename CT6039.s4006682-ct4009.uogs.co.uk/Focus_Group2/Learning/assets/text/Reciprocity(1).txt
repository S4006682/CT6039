Fred sends a text message to Jack, posing as a representative of a charity organization. His message claims that Jack has been selected to receive a special gift or prize as a thank-you for their previous donation to the organization. His message then provides a link for Jack to claim their gift or prize. Feeling grateful for the supposed gift or prize, Jack clicks on the link and is taken to a fake website where he is prompted to enter his personal information or credit card details to claim the gift or prize. In reality, there is no gift or prize, and Fred uses the reciprocity principle to manipulate the victim into providing their personal information.
