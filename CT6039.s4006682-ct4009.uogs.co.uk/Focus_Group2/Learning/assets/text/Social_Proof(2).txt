Fred is using the principle of social proof by creating a fake social media profile that looks like it belongs to a well-known company or celebrity. By claiming that many others have already tried and loved his product or service with fake comments from supposedly satisfied customers, Fred creates the impression that the offer is legitimate and desirable. This influences Jack's tendency to follow the crowd and seek validation from others.
