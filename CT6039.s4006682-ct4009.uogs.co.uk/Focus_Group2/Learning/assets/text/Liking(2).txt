Fred uses the "liking" principle of influence to persuade Jack to comply with Fred's request. This principle suggests that people are more likely to comply with requests from individuals they like or share common interests. In this scenario, Fred takes advantage of this principle by creating a fake social media profile and engaging with employees who share similar interests. By building relationships and gaining their trust over time, Fred can establish a liking for Jack, making him more likely to comply with Fred's request to click on the phishing link disguised as a project proposal.
