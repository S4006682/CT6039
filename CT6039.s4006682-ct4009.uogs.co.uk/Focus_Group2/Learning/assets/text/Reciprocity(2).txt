Fred uses the principle of reciprocity to create a sense of obligation in the victim. By claiming that his victim has been selected to receive a special gift or prize as a thank-you for their previous donation to the organization, Fred is leveraging Jack's perception of themselves as a generous and charitable person. As a result, Jack is more likely to comply with the attacker's request for personal information because he feels that he owes the organization something in return for the gift or prize.
