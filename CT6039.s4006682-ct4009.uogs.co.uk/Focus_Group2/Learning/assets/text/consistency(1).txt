Fred creates a fake charity organization similar to the one Jack has already pledged to donate and sends an email asking for confirmation of Jack's donation details. The email includes a link to a fake login page that looks like the company's internal login page. Jack, wanting to follow through on his pledge to help, clicks on the link and provides his login credentials, which Fred then uses to access the company's sensitive information.
