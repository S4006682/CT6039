Fred sends an SMS message to Jack, pretending to be a romantic interest or a celebrity. The message states that Jack has won a special prize or has been selected for a VIP experience. Fred then asks Jack to click on a link to claim the prize or to provide his personal information. Jack, flattered and excited by Fred's offer, clicks on the link and provides the requested information, not realizing he is being scammed.
