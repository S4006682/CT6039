Jack emails the victim, posing as a high-ranking official from Jack's company or government agency. The email states that Jack needs to provide sensitive information to complete a security check or to prevent a data breach. Fred then requests Jack's login credentials or asks them to download a malware attachment. Thinking they are following a legitimate request from a trusted authority figure, Jack complies with the request and unknowingly gives Fred access to their sensitive information.
