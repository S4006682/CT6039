Freds wants to steal credit card information of Jack. Fred starts by creating a fake charity organization and a fake social media account for the charity. Next, Fred sends a message to Jack through social media, stating that the charity organization is running a campaign to help underprivileged children. Next, Fred asks Jack to make a small donation by clicking on a link to a donation page. Thinking he is supporting a legitimate charity, Jack clicks on the link and enters his credit card information. Fred then uses the stolen credit card information to make unauthorized purchases or commit fraud.
