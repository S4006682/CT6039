Fred calls his victim, posing as a customer service representative from a bank or a credit card company. Fred claims that there has been suspicious activity on Jack's account and that he needs to verify his identity to prevent fraud. Fred then asks Jack to provide his account number, social security number, and other personal information. Fred also tells Jack that other customers have already cooperated and that it is a standard procedure. Feeling pressured to act quickly and not be left behind by his peers, Jack provides the requested information without realizing that he is being scammed.
