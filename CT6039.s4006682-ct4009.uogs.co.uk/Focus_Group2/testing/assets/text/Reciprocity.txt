Fred sends an email to Jack, posing as a customer service representative from a well-known company. The email states that the company is offering a special discount to its valued customers, and to claim the discount, Jack needs to provide some personal information. Fred then asks for Jack's name, address, phone number, and credit card details. Thinking they are getting a good deal, Jack provides the requested information without realising he is being scammed.
