Fred sends an email to Jack, claiming that there is a limited-time offer on a product that is in high demand. The email states that if Jack does not act quickly, he will miss out on the opportunity to purchase the product at a discounted price. Fred then includes a link to a fake website that looks like the company's legitimate website. Feeling the urgency of the situation, Jack clicks on the link and enters his personal and financial information, thinking he is getting a good deal before the offer ends.
